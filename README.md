## Venture funding with deep learning

Using past metrics on successful or unsuccessful start up ventures (through our database of collected ventures), we predict the potential applicants currently with our neural network system using tensorflow and Sequential to determine if we should fund them or not.

### encoding our database of past ventures

With the 116 columns of encoded info, we can put this into our neural network model to predict current applicants

### results of example models - model1, A1, A2

Here are some example model predictions using sampled metrics to find out if our trained models can give a better prediction on data with higher accuracy (can be adjusted to find optimal levels of neural networking)

As we can see, depending on the adjusted nodes in our model, we can determine which model is the best at predicting accuracy of whether or not a business applying for our venture capital funding is likely to be successful or not
